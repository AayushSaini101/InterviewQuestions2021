1) What is C++?
C++ is an object-oriented programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. It was released in 1985.
C++ is a superset of C with the major addition of classes in C language.
Initially, Stroustrup called the new language "C with classes". However, after sometime the name was changed to C++. 
The idea of C++ comes from the C increment operator ++.
  
2) What are the advantages of C++?
C++ doesn't only maintains all aspects from C language, it also simplifies memory management and adds several features like:
C++ is a highly portable language means that the software developed using C++ language can run on any platform.
C++ is an object-oriented programming language which includes the concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.
C++ has the concept of inheritance. Through inheritance, one can eliminate the redundant code and can reuse the existing classes.
Data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs so that the program cannot be attacked by the invaders.
Message passing is a technique used for communication between the objects.
C++ contains a rich function library.
  
3) What is a class?
The class is a user-defined data type. The class is declared with the keyword class. 
The class contains the data members, and member functions whose access is defined by the three modifiers are private, public and protected.
The class defines the type definition of the category of things. It defines a datatype, but it does not define the data it just specifies the structure of data.
You can create N number of objects from a class.
  
4) What are the various OOPs concepts in C++?
The various OOPS concepts in C++ are:
Class:
The class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. 
For example, Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties, and the actions performed by the body parts are known as functions.
The class does not occupy any memory space. Therefore, we can say that the class is the only logical representation of the data.
  
Object:
An object is a run-time entity. An object is the instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item. 
An object can operate on both data members and member functions. The class does not occupy any memory space. 
When an object is created using a new keyword, then space is allocated for the variable in a heap, and the starting address is stored in the stack memory. 
When an object is created without a new keyword, then space is not allocated in the heap memory, and the object contains the null value in the stack.
  
Inheritance:
Inheritance provides reusability. Reusability means that one can use the functionalities of the existing class. It eliminates the redundancy of code.
Inheritance is a technique of deriving a new class from the old class. The old class is known as the base class, and the new class is known as derived class.
  
Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a technique of wrapping the data members and member functions in a single unit.
It binds the data within a class, and no outside method can access the data. If the data member is private, then the member function can only access the data.
  
Abstraction:
Abstraction is a technique of showing only essential details without representing the implementation details. 
If the members are defined with a public keyword, then the members are accessible outside also. 
If the members are defined with a private keyword, then the members are not accessible by the outside methods.

Data binding:
Data binding is a process of binding the application UI and business logic. Any change made in the business logic will reflect directly to the application UI.

Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means multiple forms. Polymorphism means having more than one function with the same name but with different functionalities. Polymorphism is of two types:
  Static polymorphism is also known as early binding.
  Dynamic polymorphism is also known as late binding.
    
5) Define token in C++.
A token in C++ can be a keyword, identifier, literal, constant and symbol.
